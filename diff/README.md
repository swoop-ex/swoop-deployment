# Swoop vs Uniswap V2

## Smart Contracts

The Swoop smart contract code is a very similar to the original code for the Uniswap V2 contracts.

Solidity versions used to compile the contracts are `=0.5.16` and `>=0.6.0` (same as original Uniswap V2).

Diff files between the original Uniswap V2 and Swoop contracts are available in the sub folders [core](core/), [periphery](periphery/) and [lib](lib/).

Empty diff/patch files signify that there are no changes between the original Uniswap V2 code and the code used in Swoop.
